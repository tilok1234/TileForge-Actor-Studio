# TileForge Actor Studio Handoff

This is the canonical continuation point for a new agent or chat.

## Start here

Work only in:

```text
C:\Users\headc\Documents\TileForge-Actor-Studio
```

Before editing, run:

```powershell
Get-Location
git status -sb
git log -3 --oneline --decorate
```

Then read, in order:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. this handoff
3. `README.md`
4. `contracts/tileforge-actor-32-v1.json`
5. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
6. `docs/AGENT_WORKFLOW.md`
7. `docs/ROADMAP.md`
8. `docs/DECISIONS.md`

Do not assume the handoff is newer than Git. Reconcile it with the live branch,
working tree, and tests.

## Product intent

TileForge Actor Studio is a deliberately narrow AI-assisted desktop workflow
for creating one 32 px TileForge mob or NPC at a time:

```text
Brief -> Concept -> Turnaround -> Animate -> World test -> Export
```

The artist describes identity and mood. The versioned contract supplies the
world boundaries. Agents may create, compare, validate, and prepare candidates,
but only the user may approve final art or publishing.

## Repository and boundaries

- Remote: `https://github.com/tilok1234/TileForge-Actor-Studio`
- Default branch: `main`
- Initial baseline commit: `595da2d`
- Local generated state: `.studio/` (ignored)
- External `animation_editor_live`: read-only reference; never edit it
- External `Semantic tile generator design`: read-only reference; never edit it

This is a clean-room project. Do not add either external repository as a
runtime dependency or write generated assets back into them.

## Implemented now

| Area | Current state |
| --- | --- |
| Desktop shell | Tauri 2 shell with a Svelte 5 UI |
| Workflow UI | Six-stage navigation and polished three-panel layout |
| Brief | Editable name, mob/NPC kind, and description |
| Prompt | Live contract-constrained prompt preview |
| UI session | Creates an atomic durable session and advances to Concept |
| Session restore | Reopens the newest valid local session on desktop startup |
| Saved identity | Shows session id, revision, contract id, and saved workspace |
| Candidate intake | Imports a local 32 x 32 transparent PNG as a new immutable Concept revision |
| Candidate restore | Reopens, lists, and reads saved candidates through either adapter |
| Candidate comparison | Switches revisions and previews them at 1x, 8x, and 16x |
| Candidate evidence | Shows provenance, SHA-256 identity, and structural-intake status without implying visual acceptance |
| Contract | JSON Schema, versioned JSON instance, and TypeScript representation |
| Approval | Human-only approval boundary shown in UI, contract, prompt, and MCP |
| MCP | Stdio and localhost Streamable HTTP transports |
| MCP tools | Contract read, prompt compile, session create/list/get, and candidate import/list/get |
| Shared storage | Tauri and MCP adapters use one atomic `.studio/sessions` and immutable candidate protocol |
| Compatibility | Shared session/candidate fixtures plus TypeScript and Rust failure-path tests |
| Agent guidance | `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, project rules, and skill |
| App icon | Generated Tauri desktop/mobile icon set from `src-tauri/icons/icon.svg` |

## Not implemented yet

- No image-generation provider is selected or integrated.
- M02 intake checks PNG decoding, dimensions, and transparency; the full M03
  deterministic validator suite does not exist yet.
- No pinned TileForge reference pack exists yet.
- Turnaround, animation, world-test, and export stages are visual shells.
- No approved-candidate promotion or publishing operation exists.
- Tauri bundling/installers are disabled in `tauri.conf.json`.
- The contract JSON import is typed, but full JSON-Schema validation is not yet
  an automated test.

Do not describe any item in this section as working until it has implementation
and verification evidence.

## Architecture snapshot

- `src/` contains the Svelte UI and client-neutral TypeScript domain helpers.
- `src-tauri/` contains the native shell and durable session commands.
- `contracts/` is the versioned machine-readable art/world contract.
- `mcp/` exposes the domain over MCP and uses the shared filesystem protocol.
- `.studio/` is the ignored local workspace for sessions and immutable candidates.

The shared boundary is documented in `docs/DECISIONS.md`: both thin adapters
use the same session and candidate documents, identity rules, brief limits,
directory layout, hash checks, and atomic publish behavior.
`tests/fixtures/session-v1.json` and
`tests/fixtures/concept-candidate-v1.json` guard cross-language compatibility.

## Verification evidence

M02 was verified on Windows with Node 24.15.0, npm 11.12.1, and Rust 1.95:

- `npm run check` — 0 errors and 0 warnings
- `npm run build` — production bundle built
- `npm run test:mcp` — eight tools, locked approval contract, shared
  session/candidate compatibility, validation, byte preservation, and atomic
  failure cleanup passed
- `npm run test:mcp:stdio` — real stdio transport passed
- `npm run test:mcp:http` — real localhost HTTP transport passed while server ran
- `cargo fmt --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --check` — passed
- `cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml` — passed
- `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml` — seven session/candidate
  persistence and failure-path tests passed
- `npm audit --audit-level=moderate` — 0 vulnerabilities
- Native desktop QA — the app restored a shared session and two unreviewed
  candidates created through the MCP adapter; revision switching and 1x, 8x,
  and 16x previews remained available without exposing approval controls

Re-run checks relevant to any new change. For the HTTP smoke test, start
`npm run mcp:http` in a separate terminal first.

## Recommended next milestone

Implement **M03: Contract Validation** from `docs/ROADMAP.md`. Build
deterministic evidence on top of immutable M02 candidates, keep structural
results distinct from human visual acceptance, and do not add an
approval/publishing capability. Provider selection or any paid/external
generation still requires the user's authority.

## Handoff discipline

When completing a milestone:

1. update this file’s implemented/not-implemented sections;
2. update `docs/ROADMAP.md`;
3. record architecture decisions in `docs/DECISIONS.md`;
4. run and report the relevant checks;
5. preserve unrelated user changes;
6. do not commit or push unless the user explicitly requests it.
